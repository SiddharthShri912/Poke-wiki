# Poke-wiki
A Pokemon Wikipedia type of website made using the public Pokemon Api

So I used the public Api provided by pokemon to get a pokemons details as a JSON object.
Then I traveresed through the object and arrays to extract the relevant information and display it on the HTML using the table tag.
I have also added a feature which shows if you have entered a wrong name
I have used the fetch() method to make Api calls and get a response.

Features:
Upon entering a valid pokemon name, the webpage will display : Default Sprite, Shiny Sprite, First appearance game, Stats, Height, Weight and base Experience.
I have used bootstrap and vanilla css to style this webpage.

The navbar has my github linked to it

Future plans: 
1. Use a better Api to extract more information and display more information.
2. Make a more responsive style as I am still stuck on very basic designs.
3. Add some animations and improve overall styling.

A relatively small project, but I wanted to do this to get a grasp and an essence of API and I have used a public API but I wish to use better APIs in the future in my projects.
